Various types of Data Structures will be implemented

1. Sets
2. Lists
3. Collections

Tries
Key Points
The time complexity of creating a trie is O(m*n) where m = number of words in a trie and n = average length of each word.

Inserting a node in a trie has a time complexity of O(n) where n = length of the word we are trying to insert.

Inserting a node in a trie has a space complexity of O(n) where n = length of the word we are trying to insert.

Time complexity for searching a key(word) in a trie is O(n) where n = length of the word we are searching.

Space complexity for searching a key(word) in a trie is O(1).

Searching for a prefix of a key(word) also has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1).
